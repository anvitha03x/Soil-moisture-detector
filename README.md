# Automated Soil Moisture Detection and Water Supply System ðŸŒ±ðŸ’§
  

Our innovative project uses Arduino UNO, a soil moisture sensor, and a relay-controlled water pump to create a smart irrigation system. The soil moisture sensor monitors the water level in the soil, sending real-time data to the Arduino. Based on the readings:  

- If soil moisture is low: The system activates the water pump, ensuring timely watering.  
- If soil moisture is adequate: The pump remains off, conserving water.  

The 16x2 LCD screen displays clear messages about the soil condition and pump status, while the serial monitor logs sensor readings for analysis. This eco-friendly solution optimizes water usage, making it ideal for gardens, farms, and sustainable irrigation systems.  

ðŸ”§ Components used:  
- Arduino UNO for control.  
- Soil moisture sensor to measure water levels.  
- Relay module to switch the water pump.  
- LCD display for user interaction.  

This project is a step toward smarter farming and efficient resource management.
